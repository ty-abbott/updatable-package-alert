# updatable-package-alert
Used to send me notifications on which packages are updatable on my linux servers


## Work in progress

## TO DO

### Going forward
- use the commands apt update apt && list --upgradable to list out what packages are upgradable -> into a text file or such and then use twilio or something to send it to me via email
